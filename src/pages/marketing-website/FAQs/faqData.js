    question: 'Can an LMS adapt to the changing needs of my organization?',
    response: ` Of course, as long as your organization's needs don't change too much, and you're willing to shell out big bucks for every minor customization.`,
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    question: 'Is training through an LMS effective for remote teams?',

    id: 17,
    question: 'How user-friendly is the mobile experience of an LMS?',
    response: `  About as user-friendly as trying to juggle flaming torches while riding a unicycle on a tightrope. But hey, at least it's mobile-responsive!`,

  {
    id: 19,
    question: 'What kind of technical support is available for an LMS?',
    response: ` Oh, you know, the usual: automated chatbots that respond with pre-written scripts and a help desk that's always "experiencing higher than normal call volumes."`,
  },

    id: 20,
    question: 'Are there any hidden costs associated with implementing an LMS?',
    response: ` Hidden costs? Ha! It's more like a treasure hunt, except instead of finding gold at the end, you discover unexpected fees and upgrade charges.`,
